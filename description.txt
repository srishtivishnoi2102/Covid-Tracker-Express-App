 Fight Against Covid 19, FrontEnd: JS + Backend:Python


You are the part of INDSCI SIM in the fight against Covid 19. You are tasked with 
providing a dashboard of number of cases in various states. You need to provide an API
for all states to update their counts every day. Each state calls your api to update for
each of their district. This has the following fields Date, State Short Code, District,
Observation (one of confirmed, hospitalized, recovered, fatal), count. Example would be
KA, Bangalore Urban, confirmed, 10. All of the counts are cumulative.
Further, you are provided the district connectivity information as well. There are 739
districts in India. You are given a list of list (adjacency list in Graph terminology), size
of outer list is 739. This list represents which districts are connected to each other. So
the list is of form dist conn = [[201, 202, 331], [722, 201], ...] and size(dist conn) is 739.
In this case, district ’0’ is connected to district ’201’, ’202’ and ’331’, similarly District ’1’
is connected to ’722’ and ’201’. A district is considered high risk, if any of the following
is true
1. If there are more than 30 fatalities
2. If there are more than 30 hospitalized cases and confirmed is more than 50
3. If the absolute difference between confirmed and recovered is more than 100
Now provide a simple front end page, which allows the user to do the following.
1. Allows user to Select a State, District and Date. This then get counts for all four
observations and risk status. Assume this will be called between 1000 - 10000
times / hr.
2. Select a State & District and show whether a district is a high risk regions: Will
be called 1000 - 10000 times / hr.

3. Show extreme risk regions/districts: A region is said to be extreme risk, if more
than 70% of its connected districts are high risk. Will be called upto 1000 times /
day.

2.   You need to provide an API for all states, to update their counts every day.         DONE

            POST : req.body{
                   // Date:
                    State Short Code: KA,
                    District : Bangalore Urban, 
                    Observation : (one of confirmed, hospitalized, recovered, fatal), 
                    Count : 10
            }
             Each state calls your api to update for
            each of their district. This has the following fields Date, State Short Code, District,
            Observation (one of confirmed, hospitalized, recovered, fatal), count. Example would be

3 .   Allows user to Select a State, District and Date. This then get counts for all four observations and risk status. Assume this will be called between 1000 - 10000
times / hr. 

        A district is considered high risk, if any of the following is true ::
                1. If there are more than 30 fatalities
                2. If there are more than 30 hospitalized cases and confirmed is more than 50
                3. If the absolute difference between confirmed and recovered is more than 100
        
        Approach- {
                Categorising the districts into 3 zones: 
                        Green- Less Risk---------->0 (default)
                        Orange- High Risk--------->1
                        Red- Extreme Risk--------->2 
        }
                DONE

     Now provide a simple front end page, which allows the user to do the following.

4.    Select a State & District and show whether a district is a high risk regions: Will
be called 1000 - 10000 times / hr.      DONE
